## üåü Featured Scripts

### üîó PR-2-Jira: GitHub & Jira Integration

**Description:** A single userscript that seamlessly connects GitHub Pull Requests to Jira issues with smart button placement and automatic remote link creation.

### Features

- **Unified Script**: One installation handles both GitHub and Jira functionality automatically
- **Smart Button Placement**: Adds "üìå Create PR link in Jira" buttons next to Jira links that match your configured prefix (default: "Solves: Jira")
- **Domain Detection**: Automatically detects GitHub and Jira domains to provide the right functionality
- **Configurable Prefix**: Customize which text patterns trigger button placement through the settings menu
- **Automatic Link Creation**: Clicking the button opens the Jira issue and automatically creates a remote link back to the GitHub PR
- **Multiple Issue Support**: Handles PRs that reference multiple Jira issues correctly

### How it works

The script (`pr-2-jira.js`) automatically detects the page type and provides the appropriate functionality:

1. **On GitHub PRs**: Scans for Jira links with your configured prefix and adds buttons
   
   ![PR-2-Jira GitHub button](./docs/pr-2-jira-github.gif)
   _GitHub PR view showing the smart button placement next to Jira links_

2. **On Jira Issues**: Receives PR links and automatically creates remote links in the Jira issue
   
   ![PR-2-Jira Jira link created](./docs/pr-2-jira-jira.gif)
   _Jira issue automatically receiving the PR as a remote link (notification toast shows "link already exists" in this example)_

### Configuration

Access settings through by clicking the cogwheel icon. Located next to the "Create PR link in Jira" button or in the bottom left corner.

### üé® Jira Epic Color Picker

**Description:** Replaces Jira's fixed epic color options with a proper color picker, giving you full control over epic colors.

### üõ†Ô∏è Jira Board Utils

**Description:** Add custom project icons to Jira board cards based on configurable color rules. Perfect for visual project identification and team workflows.

![Jira Board Utils Screenshot](./docs/board-utils.png)

#### Features

- **Multi-Board Support**: Each board maintains its own independent configuration
- **Dynamic Color Rules**: Automatically fetches and displays your board's card color rules from Jira
- **Project-Based Images**: Simply enter a project key (e.g., "FTWEB") to use that project's avatar
- **Smart Configuration**: Choose which color rule triggers image placement with an intuitive interface
- **Automatic Refresh**: Settings are applied instantly without manual page reloads
- **User-Friendly Setup**: Toggle on/off per board with easy-to-use settings dialog

#### How it works

1. **Open Board Settings**: Click the "Board Utils" button in your Jira board toolbar
2. **Enable for Board**: Toggle on "Enable Board Utils for this board"
3. **Choose Color Rule**: Select which card color rule should trigger the image (e.g., `project = "FTWEB"`)
4. **Set Project Image**: Enter your project key (e.g., "FTWEB") to use that project's avatar, or provide a custom image URL
5. **Save & Enjoy**: Settings are saved automatically and applied to matching cards

#### Perfect for:
- **Project Identification**: Quickly identify which project each card belongs to
- **Team Workflows**: Visual indicators for different teams or components  
- **Multi-Project Boards**: Clear separation when working with multiple projects
- **Custom Branding**: Use project avatars or custom images for better visual organization

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Development Server

For script development and testing, this repository includes a Vite-based development server that serves your userscripts locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev
```

> **Note:** You can also use `npm` or `yarn` instead of `bun` - all package managers work equally well for this project.

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` and provides:

- **Live script serving**: Access scripts at `http://localhost:3000/scripts/[script-name].js`
  - `http://localhost:3000/scripts/pr-2-jira.js`
  - `http://localhost:3000/scripts/jira-epic-color-picker.js`
  - `http://localhost:3000/scripts/boardUtils.js`
- **Web interface**: Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see all available scripts with copy-paste URLs
- **Hot reloading**: Changes to scripts are immediately available without server restart
- **CORS enabled**: Ready for Tampermonkey development workflow

#### Using with Tampermonkey Development:

1. Start the dev server with `bun dev`
2. Use the provided auto-refresh wrapper template (`auto-refresh-wrapper.js`)
3. Create a new Tampermonkey script using the template:
   - Replace `[SCRIPT NAME]` with a descriptive name
   - Replace `[ADD YOUR MATCH PATTERNS HERE]` with appropriate @match patterns  
   - Replace `[SCRIPT-FILE-NAME]` with the actual filename
4. Save the wrapper script in Tampermonkey
5. Your script will now reload automatically on every page refresh (no caching issues!)

**The wrapper uses dynamic script injection with timestamps to bypass all caching.**
